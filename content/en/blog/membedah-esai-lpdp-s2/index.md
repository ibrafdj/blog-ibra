## Submerged[c]  

**Komentar [c]:** Esai ini ku bagi jadi beberapa bagian dengan tema berbeda untuk mempermudah pembaca. Tema pertama ini membahas latar belakang permasalahan utama yang ingin aku selesaikan.  

> Pada 24 April 2021, over 838 meters deep under the waves of the Bali Sea, the wreckage of navy submarine KRI Nanggala 402 found its final resting place. All of Indonesia mourned over the loss of the submarine and the 53 brave sailors who served within. Lacking the required tools to search over 800 meters deep underwater, Indonesia had to rely on equipment from its neighbors to discover the submarine's remains. Among that equipment is the Singaporean navy’s MV *Swift Rescue*, the only vessel in Southeast Asia equipped with a unique Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for submarine rescue missions [^1]. As sorrow swept over the nation, this tragedy steeled my resolve to build the means to scour the depths where no human could: underwater robots.[d]  

**Komentar [d]:** Pembukaan dengan insiden yang baru satu tahun berlalu pada saat itu. Aku menekankan peran ROV dalam menemukan kapal selam ini karena sangat relevan dengan bidang perkuliahanku. Kalimat terakhir menonjolkan seberapa berdampak insiden ini dalam membuatku yakin atas jalan yang kupilih. Penjelasan lengkap motivasiku bisa dibaca di [link blog](https://www.ibrafdj.com/en/blog/merakit-rangkaian-mengarungi-lautan/).  

> Exploring the depths of the sea is an enormous challenge due to its crushing pressure, uneven terrain, and pitch darkness. By using underwater robots, we can submerge underwater without exposing ourselves to the dangers of the depths. There are two types of underwater robots: ROVs and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). ROVs are controlled remotely by a human pilot, while AUVs can move autonomously following a set of waypoints specified by the user.[e]  

**Komentar [e]:** Penjelasan masalah / tantangan yang diselesaikan oleh underwater robots serta dua jenis robot yang dibahas di essay ini.

## Taking a Deep Dive[f]  

**Komentar [f]:** Bagian kedua membahas pengalaman kerja / riset ku serta hubungannya dengan bidang underwater robotics.  

> I first discovered the world of underwater robotics in 2019, during my final year of Electrical Engineering studies in *Institut Teknologi Bandung* (ITB). In our last year, we work in a group to complete a capstone design project of our choosing. Out of dozens of available projects to choose from, the one-of-its-kind ITB Hybrid Underwater Glider (HUG) piqued my interest. The ITB-HUG is an AUV with two modes of movement: a low-energy glider mode and a high-precision propulsion mode. This research is being done by the ITB Control Systems and Computer Lab under Professor Bambang Riyanto Trilaksono. Fascinated by the ITB-HUG’s uniqueness, my group decided to develop the ITB-HUG as our capstone design project. Our capstone design project aims to integrate the navigation, guidance, and control systems of the ITB-HUG. Using the Robot Operating System (ROS), we successfully integrated the ITB-HUG’s navigation sensors with a gain-scheduled PID controller that moves autonomously using a path-following guidance system.[g]  

**Komentar [g]:** Penjelasan bagaimana aku mulai mengenali dunia underwater robotics. Pengenalan tim risetku di ITB dan Tugas Akhirku saat S1 Teknik Elektro ITB.  

---

> Working on the ITB-HUG ignited my passion for building robots. I was fascinated by the experience of building a robot with a multi-disciplined team of mechanical, ocean, software, and electrical engineers. After graduating from ITB, this passion drove me to continue working as a research assistant in the ITB-HUG project. During this time, I was able to register two patents I co-invented to *Dirjen Kekayaan Intelektual* Indonesia. In addition to the ITB-HUG, I assisted with another project currently being worked on by the research team: an environmental data collector AUV developed for *Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika* (BMKG) Indonesia.[h]  

**Komentar [h]:** Penjelasan kenapa aku melanjutkan riset di ITB setelah lulus dan prestasiku mendaftarkan dua paten. Link paten: [Patent 564](https://lpik.itb.ac.id//hki/detail/patent/564) dan [Patent 600](https://lpik.itb.ac.id/hki/detail/patent/600).

> My fondness for research also led me to join Samsung Research Institute Indonesia (SRIN) as a Cloud Middleware engineer. In SRIN, I researched and developed backend applications that empower Samsung cloud services. This experience enlightened me on the capability of cloud computing services to enhance the processing power of devices such as PCs, smartphones, and robots.[i]  

**Komentar [i]:** Penjelasan singkat tentang pekerjaan terakhirku sebagai software engineer. Paragraf ini mungkin kurang relevan dengan narasi esai.

## A Dream of Indonesia’s Future[j]  

**Komentar [j]:** Bagian ini membahas tujuan / visiku untuk Indonesia dan bagaimana kuliah S2 dapat membantuku menyelesaikan masalah tersebut.  

> As an archipelago of over 17.000 islands, Indonesia's vast oceans and numerous islands present various challenges for underwater robots to tackle. These challenges include constructing undersea telecommunication cables, mapping the seafloor's topography, and safeguarding Indonesia’s vast seas.[k]  

**Komentar [k]:** Contoh tujuan pemakaian underwater robots.  

---

> However, **Indonesia's capability to develop underwater robots is almost nonexistent.** There is only one company in Indonesia, *Robo Marine Indonesia*, that can manufacture its own ROVs. In addition, only four universities have research on AUVs: *Institut Teknologi Bandung*, *Institut Pertanian Bogor, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November*, and *Universitas Hasanuddin*. The lack of capacity to research and manufacture underwater robots has left Indonesia reliant on expensive foreign equipment to solve problems under its vast seas.[l]  

**Komentar [l]:** Penekanan bahwa Indonesia masih tertinggal di bidang ini. Data berdasarkan obrolan dengan dosen dan riset internet.  

---

> More importantly, this lack of capacity also presents a significant security threat. There have been three confirmed findings of foreign AUVs trespassing in Indonesia's waters between 2019 and 2020 [^2]. These AUVs were suspected to be doing surveillance missions in Indonesia's waters. This incident shows that our lack of knowledge and equipment in underwater robotics may leave us vulnerable in future naval conflicts.[m]  

**Komentar [m]:** Penekanan urgensi peningkatan kapabilitas Indonesia di bidang ini terkait isu keamanan nasional.  

---

> I envision a future where underwater robots are widely used across Indonesia. From tracking schools of fish for fishermen on Natuna to monitoring undersea oil pipes from oil rigs off the shores of East Kalimantan. However, underwater robots are a costly investment due to the high-end components and advanced expertise required to build them. This high barrier of entry is a massive problem for a developing country like Indonesia. One company that has successfully disrupted this status quo is a Silicon Valley start-up called Seadrone. Seadrone stands out by building small, inexpensive, and short-range ROVs that are more affordable for a broader market than traditional ROVs. Inspired by their success, I plan on making my own company that develops cost-effective underwater robots specifically designed to tackle Indonesia’s maritime challenges.[n]  

**Komentar [n]:** Visi utopis tentang implementasi underwater robots di Indonesia, dibenturkan dengan realita biaya tinggi, lalu ditutup dengan contoh solusi nyata.  

---

> There are many ways to reduce the cost of underwater robots. The immediate solution is to reduce the quantity and quality of the robot's components. To make a robot that can "do more with less," however, requires clever robot design, optimized control systems, and efficient processing. Pursuing higher education in those topics is the key to achieving this goal and my vision for Indonesia. I plan to achieve my vision by enrolling in a graduate program in a university with courses, projects, and research related to underwater robots. With my research experience in ITB and SRIN, I believe that I can achieve excellent grades in class while researching my thesis on AUVs.[o]  

**Komentar [o]:** "Untuk mengusahakan solusi seperti di atas, saya perlu kuliah ke jenjang yang lebih tinggi!"

## Potential Paths to The Ultimate Goal[p]  

**Komentar [p]:** Bagian ini menjelaskan tiga pilihan program dan universitas berbeda (akhirnya aku pindah ke program MSc Maritime Engineering Science di University of Southampton).  

> The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Master of Engineering program at UC Berkeley is the first choice for my graduate studies. There are four reasons why this program is an excellent fit for my future goals. First, the program allows me to specialize in robotics and embedded software. Second, this program's core leadership curriculum and capstone experience support my goal of becoming an entrepreneur with a strong engineering background. Third, enrolling here allows me to join UC Berkeley's Underwater Robotics (URobotics) student organization. Fourth, UC Berkeley's proximity to the Silicon Valley business centers enables me to converse and learn directly from people in nearby successful robotics start-ups.[q]  

**Komentar [q]:** Alasan memilih UC Berkeley: kurikulum, organisasi kemahasiswaan, dan kedekatan dengan perusahaan teknologi.  

---

> Georgia Tech's excellent history of AUV research is why its Master of Science in Robotics program is my second choice. Among Georgia Tech’s research is the Yellowfin AUV project. Studying the Yellowfin AUV's multi-AUV mission planning systems is helping me develop a similar system for the ITB-HUG. Researching this AUV also led me to discover Professor Fumin Zhang’s various research on AUV fleet formation controls. His research on a decoupled controller design for multi-AUV formation control shows that this complex subject can be further simplified and optimized. I hope to explore this topic under Professor Fumin Zhang’s guidance and develop it into my thesis.[r]  

**Komentar [r]:** Alasan memilih Georgia Tech: riset relevan tentang AUV dan rencana tesis.  

---

> My final choice is the Master of Science in Robotics at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor. This campus is home to the Perceptual Robotics Lab (PeRL), a lab studying autonomous navigation and mapping for mobile robots in unknown environments. This lab has various research related to AUV navigation, including the cooperative underwater navigation project. I plan to work on this project as my thesis with supervision from Professor Ryan Eustice. I will also join the Michigan RoboSub student team to participate in the annual RoboSub autonomous robotic submarine competition.[s]  

**Komentar [s]:** Alasan memilih University of Michigan: riset navigasi AUV dan kompetisi RoboSub.

## My Past, Present, and Future Contributions for Indonesia[t]  

**Komentar [t]:** Bagian ini membahas kontribusi yang telah dan akan aku berikan untuk Indonesia.  

> **After completing my master’s education, I am committed to returning to Indonesia and contributing my knowledge to improve Indonesia’s underwater robotics industry.** This act will not be my first nor my last contribution to Indonesia. Besides contributing to the ITB-HUG research, I have made two other significant contributions to Indonesia.[u]  

**Komentar [u]:** Kalimat bold menjelaskan rencana kontribusi secara singkat.  

---

> First, in 2019, I educated 4.465 first-year students to plan out their dreams to build the future of Indonesia by becoming the Chairman of OSKM ITB 2019. OSKM ITB is the first-year orientation event and the largest annual event in ITB. The vision of OSKM ITB 2019 was "The Spirit of dreams for Indonesia." This vision taught new students the importance of having visionary dreams that act as both a personal goal for self-actualization and an altruistic goal for solving Indonesia’s societal problems. This event also initiated six student movements supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and became the largest zero-waste event in ITB.[v]  

**Komentar [v]:** Kontribusi sebagai Ketua OSKM ITB 2019 dengan visi edukasi mahasiswa baru.

## Building Indonesia’s Underwater Power[x]  

**Komentar [x]:** Bagian ini berisi rencana jangka pendek, menengah, dan panjang untuk merealisasikan tujuan.  

> After completing my graduate studies by around 2024, my first contribution will be to rejoin the ITB-HUG as a part-time research assistant. My experience working on the vehicle since 2019, combined with knowledge gained from my master’s studies, will make me a valuable addition to improving this research. Currently, the ITB-HUG has only seen limited field testing in a 5 meters deep diving pool. This problem is due to its inability to communicate wirelessly and unoptimized control systems for long-range missions. By 2025, I plan to improve the ITB-HUG’s communication and control systems so the vehicle can perform field tests on the open seas up to 50 meters deep. Returning to work on this project also ensures I will stay up to date with the latest developments in underwater robotics research.[y]  

**Komentar [y]:** Rencana jangka pendek (2024-2025): Kembali ke ITB-HUG untuk meningkatkan sistem komunikasi dan kontrol.  

---

> At the same time, I plan to enlist as a full-time engineer in *Robo Marine Indonesia* by 2025. I will learn the challenges of designing and manufacturing underwater robots first-hand by working there. While currently, Robo Marine only manufactures ROVs, I hope to use my skills to help the company research and develop AUVs as well.[z]  

**Komentar [z]:** Rencana jangka pendek lainnya: Bekerja di Robo Marine Indonesia.  

---

> By 2028, I plan to define my future company's potential target market and business model. I hope to achieve this by spending my free time traveling around Indonesia's various islands. In my travels, I will talk with various sailors, fishermen, aquaculture entrepreneurs, offshore oil workers, oceanologists, and other stakeholders in the maritime field. By listening to the stories of their struggles first-hand, I hope to paint a clearer picture of Indonesia's maritime problems that can be solved using underwater robots. From 2028 to 2030, I hope to start developing prototype low-cost ROVs and AUVs as a minimum viable product for my future company.[aa]  

**Komentar [aa]:** Rencana jangka menengah (2028-2030): Riset pasar dan pengembangan prototipe.  

---

> By 2034, after gathering enough knowledge and funds, I plan to launch my own ROV and AUV manufacturing company. This company will start by focusing on creating low-cost underwater robots for small-scale underwater missions. The primary potential market for this product is the mapping and monitoring of ship hulls, dams, ports, and fish farms. In addition, the robot can collect environmental data such as temperature, salinity, pressure, and conductivity of shallow waters in beaches, lakes, and rivers.[ab]  

**Komentar [ab]:** Rencana jangka panjang (2034): Mendirikan perusahaan underwater robotics.  

---

> My long-term goal is to build up Indonesia’s underwater robotics industry. By manufacturing our own ROVs and AUVs, we will be able to explore and utilize every layer of our vast seas, from its shallow reefs down to its farthest depths. I intend to achieve that goal by continuing the current ITB-HUG research project, working on the only existing ROV manufacturer in Indonesia, and creating my own underwater robotics company. While this journey has started long before this day, joining LPDP is an essential step to reaching its end.[ac]  

**Komentar [ac]:** Penegasan kembali tujuan dan rencana.
