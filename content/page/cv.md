# Ibrahim Fadhil Djauhari
## Summary
An Electrical, Software, and Marine Engineer with over 4 years of experience developing maritime robotics, particularly Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Specialized in developing autonomous systems while demonstrating success in cloud engineering and IoT applications, spanning embedded systems, computer vision, and cloud architecture.

## Experience

### Research Assistant 
#### University of Southampton
*September 2024 - November 2024 (3 months)*  
Southampton, England, United Kingdom

- Developed a visual subsea cable survey system for detecting, following, and searching subsea cables into a Sparus II Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) using Python and ROS
- Deployed a computer vision model using Docker in an Nvidia Jetson board for cable detection using the AUV's onboard cameras
- Developed a cable detection API using Flask to bridge communication between the computer vision model & cable survey system
- Planned and executed the deployment of an AUV in a four-day sea trial off the coast of Plymouth to test the subsea cable survey system

### Cloud Middleware Engineer
#### Samsung R&D Institute Indonesia
*August 2021 - August 2023 (2 years 1 month)*  
Jakarta, Indonesia

- Developed Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) systems for serverless application deployment in a private cloud service using NodeJS, MongoDB, Apache Openwhisk, and AWS EC2
- Developed Point-of-Interest (POI) Search API with nearby, geocoding, and full-text search features using NodeJS, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch
- Deployed POI Search API serving ~7 million POIs used by Samsung applications in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions using AWS EKS and Kubernetes
- Developed automated CI/CD pipeline with Blue-Green deployment strategy using Github API, AWS SNS, and AWS EC2 to ensure 100% uptime of POI Search API
- Developed real-time monitoring dashboards using Grafana and Loki to visualise POI Search API performance
