I am a Robotics Software Engineer with five years of experience in end-to-end mobile robot development, from novel research concepts to optimised field-tested systems in resource-constrained devices. Proven expertise in developing ROS-based systems for navigation, sensor fusion, computer vision, and SLAM, validated by two patents and two academic publications. Specialising in the research and development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).
