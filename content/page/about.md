I am a Robotics Engineer based in Indonesia with five years of experience in end-to-end mobile robot development, taking novel research concepts into optimised field-tested systems. I have proven expertise in developing ROS-based systems for navigation, sensor fusion, computer vision, and SLAM, validated by two patents and two academic publications. I specialise in the research and development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).
