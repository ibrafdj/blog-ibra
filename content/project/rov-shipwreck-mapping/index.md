This project, part of a joint research mission between Rovostech with Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), focused on developing and applying ROV-based photogrammetry methods for mapping underwater archaeological sites. The primary objective was to acquire high-resolution visual data of sunken shipwrecks (KM Posso and KM Tabularasa) at 30m depths, enabling detailed 3D reconstruction for maritime archaeology.

The operation utilized the battery-powered ROVOCEAN, a observation-class ROV rated at 150m depth modified with a high-resolution stereo GoPro payload, additional lighting, and a USBL transponder for sub-meter position tracking. The survey plan involved navigating the ROV in a systematic lawn-mower pattern at a close distance to capture high-overlap imagery required for photogrammetric processing. This procedure was executed from a surface support vessel in challenging open-sea conditions near Pramuka Island.

The project faced significant operational challenges, most notably strong undersea currents that frequently exceeded the ROV's thrust capacity. This required careful piloting and tether management, particularly during the KM Posso survey where the ROV was pushed to its 250m operational tether limit while coordinating with divers and a multi-vessel team.

The mission successfully resulted in capturing high-quality photogrammetry image datasets, which was then processed into 3D reconstructions of the surveyed underwater objects. The project's post-mission analysis also produced critical operational insights and recommendations for managing complex ROV surveys in challenging deep-water, multi-vessel, and diver-assisted missions.
